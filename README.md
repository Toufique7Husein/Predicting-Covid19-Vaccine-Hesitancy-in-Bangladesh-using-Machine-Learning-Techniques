# Predicting-Covid19-Vaccine-Hesitancy-in-Bangladesh-using-Machine-Learning-Techniques
The COVID-19 virus has sparked a global epidemic, halting many enterprises and
restricting daily activities. Residents must be vaccinated in order to stop the virus from spreading
in a small country like Bangladesh. The purpose of this study is to investigate and describe the
general attitude of inhabitants of Bangladesh toward the vaccine, as well as any areas of hesitancy
they may have. This study utilized a nationally representative cross-sectional survey. The study
included 1134 participants from the general community who were 18 years of age or older. The
survey assessed a range of sociodemographic and psychological variables (i.e., perceived COVID19 risk). Vaccine hesitancy proportions were calculated and compared between groups with the
aid of descriptive analysis. To get the adjusted OR, multiple logistic regression analyses were
conducted. A comprehensive search method identified the key causes of willingness and hesitation
with the COVID-19 vaccine. For analysis, regression models and test-train machine learning
techniques were applied. The findings demonstrated that dominance analysis helped identify the
primary barriers and promoters of vaccine usage and that respondent characteristics can be utilized
to predict vaccination attitude.
